# Feature support matrix

As described in [GIP-0008](https://snapshot.org/#/council.graphprotocol.eth/proposal/0xbdd884654a393620a7e8665b4289201b7542c3ee62becfad133e951b0c408444), the Feature support matrix defines indexing & querying features which are experimental or not fully supported for indexing & query rewards and arbitration.

The matrix below reflects the canonical Council-ratified version. As outlined in GIP-00008, Council ratification is currently required for each update, which may happen at different stages of feature development and testing lifecycle.

The accepted `graph-node` version range must always be specified; it always comprises the latest available version and the one immediately preceding it.
The latest for the feature matrix above:

```
graph-node: >=0.35.0 <0.36.0
```

### Latest Council snapshot

[GGP-0043: Updated Feature Matrix Support (base, bsc, scroll, linea)](https://snapshot.org/#/council.graphprotocol.eth/proposal/0x4226f917346416b76f77369181881bebbc9b4e3f66e9681e5fc4e56d7460eba7)

### Other notes

- Currently, one single matrix is used to reflect protocol behaviour for both Ethereum mainnet and Arbitrum One.
- Aliases can be used in subgraph manifest files to refer to specific networks.
- Experimental features are generally not fully supported for indexing rewards and arbitration, and usage of experimental features will be considered during any arbitration that does occur.
- Query fees apply to all queries, regardless of the underlying features used by a subgraph.
- Subgraph features not named in the matrix are assumed to be fully supported for indexing & query rewards and arbitration
