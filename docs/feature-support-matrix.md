# Feature support matrix

As described in [GIP-0008](https://snapshot.org/#/council.graphprotocol.eth/proposal/0xbdd884654a393620a7e8665b4289201b7542c3ee62becfad133e951b0c408444), this defines indexing & querying features which are experimental or not fully supported for indexing & query rewards and arbitration.

Each deployment of The Graph Network has its own specific Feature support matrix, as features will be introduced to testnet & mainnet at different stages of the development and testing lifecycle.

An example:

| Subgraph Feature         | Aliases | Implemented | Experimental | Query Arbitration | Indexing Arbitration | Indexing Rewards |
|--------------------------|---------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| **Core Features**        |         |             |              |                   |                      |                  |

The accepted `graph-node` version range is also specificied; it always comprises of the latest available version and the one immediately preceding it. Here's an example of a version range which includes both 0.30.X and 0.31.X:

```
graph-node: >=0.30 <0.32
```

- Aliases can be used in subgraph manifest files to refer to specific networks.
- Experimental features are generally not fully supported for indexing rewards and arbitration, and usage of experimental features will be considered during any arbitration that does occur.
- Query fees apply to all queries, regardless of the underlying features used by a subgraph.
- Subgraph features not named in the matrix are assumed to be fully supported for indexing & query rewards and arbitration
