# Indexer Errors

## IE001

**Summary**

The indexer agent is unable to run database migrations.

**Solution**

The agent is logging the error that causes the migrations to fail. There could
be numerous reasons. If the reason is not clear to you, check with the
community.

## IE002

**Summary**

The URL used to connect to Ethereum is invalid.

**Solution**

TODO

## IE003

**Summary**

Failed to index network subgraph.

**Solution**

TODO

## IE004

**Summary**

Failed to synchronize with network.

**Description**

The indexer agent has failed fetching network data from either the contracts
or the network subgraph, or has issues fetching current deployments and
indexing rules from its graph/index node or nodes or its own database.
Potential reasons for this:

- The Ethereum node or provider configured via `INDEXER_AGENT_ETHEREUM` or
  `--ethereum` is unhealthy or is rate limiting requests from the indexer.
- The network subgraph endpoint configured via
  `INDEXER_AGENT_NETWORK_SUBGRAPH_ENDPOINT` or `--network-subgraph-endpoint` is
  unhealthy, cannot be reached for other reasons, or is outdated.
- There indexer agent is unable to reach the indexing status API of the graph/index
  node or nodes.
- The indexer agent is unable to obtain a database connection or the query for
  indexing rules fails for some reason.

As usual, the error message contains details about what is going wrong
specifically.

**Solution**

The solution depends on which of potential causes listed above is causing the
`IE004` error.

If the Ethereum node or provider is the culprit, switching the node or provider
or (in the case of a provider) upgrading the provider subscription may help.

If it is a connection issue between the indexer agent and graph/index node or
nodes, this is typically an issue specific to the indexer infrastructure and
needs to be investigated by the indexer. The same goes for database connection
issues.

If the network subgraph endpoint is unhealthy or throwing issues that suggest it
can be reached but is not behaving correctly, please collect the `IE004` error
logs and file an issue on <https://github.com/graphprotocol/indexer>:

```bash
grep <logs> | grep IE004
```

## IE005

**Summary**

Failed to reconcile indexer and network.

**Description**

The indexer agent failed performing one of the following actions:

1. Starting or stopping subgraph deployments that match the indexer's
   indexing rules.
2. Creating or closing allocations for subgraph deployments that match the
   indexer's indexing rules.
3. Claiming rebate rewards for already closed allocations.

The error message logged along with this error code includes details about
which of the above went wrong. Typical examples of problems that lead to
`IE005`:

- The indexer agent is unable to reach the graph/index node or nodes to
  create deployments.
- Allocation transactions fail due to a lack of ETH.
- The indexer has run out of free stake to allocate to subgraphs.

See also: [#IE013](#ie013), [#IE020](#ie020).

**Solution**

The solution depends on which of the above problems causes the `IE005` error
to be reported. Make sure that

- Indexer agent can connect and deploy to the graph/index node or nodes fine.
- The indexer has sufficient ETH.
- The indexer has sufficient free stake to create new allocations. If this is
  the case, reduce the allocation amount until some of the existing 
  allocations have been closed and have released the allocated GRT again. 
  In this case, the situation should resolve automatically.

## IE006

**Summary**

Failed to cross-check allocation state with contracts.

**Solution**

TODO

## IE007

**Summary**

Failed to check for network pause.

**Solution**

Reference IE004. 

## IE008

**Summary**

Failed to check operator status for indexer.

**Solution**

TODO

## IE009

**Summary**

Failed to query subgraph deployments worth indexing.

**Description**

The indexer service or agent failed querying the network subgraph via the URL
defined in one of the following environment variables / command-line options:

- `INDEXER_AGENT_NETWORK_SUBGRAPH_ENDPOINT` / `--network-subgraph-endpoint`
- `INDEXER_SERVICE_NETWORK_SUBGRAPH_ENDPOINT` / `--network-subgraph-endpoint`

There can be a nuber of reasons for this:

- The endpoint is unhealthy or unreliable.
- The endpoint is out of date.
- There are other networking issues between the indexer and the endpoint.

> **Note:** It is ok if this error shows up sporadically due to the network subgraph
> endpoint being rebooted or similar. However, if it keeps getting reported
> constantly, it will negatively impact the indexer's functionality.

**Solution**

Search the indexer service and agent logs for the `IE010` error code, e.g.
with

```bash
grep <logs> | grep IE010
```

File an issue on https://github.com/graphprotocol/indexer/issues with the
matching logs attached.

## IE010

**Summary**

Failed to query indexer allocations.

**Solution**

TODO

## IE011

**Summary**

Failed to query claimable indexer allocations.

**Solution**

TODO

## IE012

**Summary**

Failed to register indexer.

**Solution**

TODO

## IE013

**Summary**

Failed to allocate: insufficient free stake.

**Description**

This is a sub-error of `IE005`. It is reported when an indexer has locked up
all of their stake in existing allocations and there is no free stake to use
for creating new allocations

**Solution**

The indexer has sufficient free stake to create new allocations. If this is
the case, reduce the allocation amount on some of the deployments in the 
indexing rules and wait until some of the existing allocations have been 
closed and have released the allocated GRT again. In this case, the 
situation should resolve automatically.

**Solution**

TODO

## IE020

**Summary**

Failed to ensure subgraph deployment is indexing.

**Description**

This is a sub-error of `IE005`. It is reported when the indexer agent fails
to ensure that a subgraph deployment is deployed and being indexed on the
graph/index node or nodes.

Typical reasons that can cause this:

- The indexer agent fails to connect to the graph/index node or nodes.
- The subgraph deployment is for a network (e.g. Ropsten) that is not
  supported by the graph/index node or nodes.

**Solution**

Connection issues between the indexer agent and graph/index node or nodes are
specific to the indexer setup and need to be investigated on a case by case
basis.

If the subgraph network is not supported by the graph/index node or nodes,
this can be resolved by adding an Ethereum node or provider for this network
to the graph/index node configuration.

## IE032

**Summary**

Failed to process paid query.

**Description**

Failing to process a paid query can have a number of reasons:

- The indexer service is out of sync with the network. Specifically, it
  hasn't detected the allocations made by the indexer agent yet. The most
  likely cause for this is that the network subgraph endpoint specified via
  `INDEXER_SERVICE_NETWORK_SUBGRAPH_ENDPOINT` or `--network-subgraph-endpoint`
  is unhealthy and failing repeatedly. This particular situation would manifest
  itself in a `Unable to sign the query response attesattion` error message.
- The indexer service either fails to forward queries to the graph/query node
  or nodes, or the graph/query node or nodes fail to execute the query.
- The indexer service fails to push the payment or attestation into the
  server wallet, either due to a problem with the database or corrupt/invalid
  payment or receipt messages.

**Solution**

If there are no `IE010` errors before the `IE032`, the problem is most likely
in the gateway sending the query. In this case, please get in touch with the
Graph team.

Due to the complexity of this error message, the best advice is to grep the
indexer service logs for any `IE0*` errors and create an issue on
https://github.com/graphprotocol/indexer/issues:

```bash
grep <logs> | grep IE0
```

## IE033

**Summary**

Failed to process free query.

**Solution**

TODO

## IE034

**Summary**

Not authorized as an operator for the indexer.

**Description**

This error is reported when the indexer and operator addresses are different
and the operator address is not registered as an operator for the indexer.

**Solution**

Add the operator address to your indexer in the explorer. The operator address
is included in the error message.

## IE035

**Summary**

An asynchronous operation (promise) failed somewhere in the system but this
error wasn't handled. A frequent cause for these are failed promises internal to
ethers.js, which have caused indexer-agent and index-service to crash.

**Solution**

If this error is related to ethers.js and Ethereum requests, there _may_ be
issues with your Ethereum node or provider, but it may also simply be an
internal error in ethers.js, in which case you can ignore this error.

If the error is _not_ related to Ethereum requests, it is likely to be an
unhandled error in indexer-agent and indexer-service and is best reported as an
issue on https://github.com/graphprotocol/indexer/issues.

## IE036

**Summary**

An operation failed somewhere in the system but this error wasn't handled.

**Solution**

This is likely to be an unhandled error in indexer-agent and indexer-service and
is best reported as an issue on https://github.com/graphprotocol/indexer/issues.

**Summary**

There is a problem looking up Vector transfers for closed allocations from
the database. This is most likely due to a database connection issue.

**Solution**

Check the logs for details about database issues. It could be that
the database cannot be reached for some reason.

## IE042

**Summary**

A Vector transfer cannot be stored in the database. Most likely, this is a
database connection error but it could also be a bug caused by a conflict
with data that is already in the database. The error cause in the logs should
reveal what the exact problem is.

**Solution**

See also: [#IE041](#ie041).

## IE043

**Summary**

A Vector transfer cannot be marked as resolved in the database. Most likely,
this is a database connection error but it could also be a bug caused by a
conflict with data that is already in the database. The error cause in the
logs should reveal what the exact problem is.

## IE060

**Summary**

Failed to allocate: subgraph is already allocated to.

**Solution**

The Indexer already has an active allocation on this subgraph so a new one cannot be created. This error can typically be ignored.

## IE061

**Summary**

Failed to allocate: Invalid allocation amount provided.

**Solution**

Allocation amounts must be non-negative numbers. To resolve this issue ensure the corresponding indexer rule and/or action queue item have `allocationAmount` specified to be greater or equal to 0.

## IE062

**Summary**

Action was not executed successfully: contracts paused or operator not authorized.

**Solution**

Cannot confirm `allocateFrom`, `closeAllocation`, or `closeAndAllocate` transactions completed successfully. Please ensure the indexer operator is authorized, calls to the network contracts from your indexer-agent machine can be made, and the network is not paused.

## IE063

**Summary**

Failed to unallocate: No active allocation with provided id found.

**Solution**

The Indexer must have an active allocation to perform an unallocate action on that subgraph deployment. Please ensure the correct allocation id for an existing active allocation is provided.

## IE064

**Summary**

Failed to unallocate: Allocations cannot be closed during this epoch as it was created in this epoch.

**Solution**

An allocation cannot be closed within the same epoch that it was created in. Wait until the next epoch and the error should resolve and the unallocate action will be executed.

## IE065

**Summary**

Failed to unallocate: Allocation has already been closed.

**Solution**

Check the allocation ID and network sync status. If the allocation ID is correct and allocation is closed, then there's nothing to be done. 

## IE066

**Summary**

Allocation not created: Allocation ID already exist.

**Solution**

Duplicate allocation ids are not permitted. Check the network subgraph sync status, if it is caught up and an allocation still needs to be opened, agent will create a new unique allocation ID and try again.

## IE067

**Summary**

Failed to resolve POI: POI not available for deployment at current epoch start block.

**Solution**

This error typically indicates a subgraph deployment that is too far behind the chain head to resolve a valid POI for closing the allocation. To successfully resolve the POI and close the allocation you'll need to wait for the index node to sync the deployment enough to generate a POI for the current epoch start block. If you do not want to wait to sync you may choose to forfeit indexing rewards for the allocation by force closing it with a 0 POI by creating an unallocate or reallocate action item: `graph indexer actions queue unallocate/reallocate <deployment-id> <allocation-id> 0 true`.

## IE068

**Summary**

Failed to resolve POI: User provided POI does not match reference fetched from the graph-node.

**Solution**

Check sync and health status of the subgraph to access the issue. If needed, provide a POI or use `--force` to bypass POI checks. 

## IE069

**Summary**

Failed to query Epoch Block Oracle Subgraph

**Solution**

Check `epoch-subgraph-endpoint` query endpoint for its syncing status and the EBO contract state. 

## IE070

**Summary**

Failed to query BlockHashFromNumber from graph node

**Solution**

Graph-node could not find the block hash given network and block number, check if graph-node has access to a network client that has synced to the required block, and ensure indexer agent is connect to the index node configured with an RPC endpoint from the required network

## IE071

**Summary**

Epoch subgraph required for subgraphs indexing networks in which rpc is unprovided to the indexer agent

**Description**

This is a sub-error of `IE069`. It is reported when the indexer agent doesn't have access to an epoch subgraph endpoint to identify the epoch start block for chains other than the settlement network as indicated by start-up option `--ethereum-network`. 

**Solution**

Please provide a `epoch-subgraph-endpoint` and make sure graph node has consistent network configurations (`mainnet`, `sepolia`, `gnosis`) and is on or after version 0.28.0.
