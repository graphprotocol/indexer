# Indexer Integration Tests

This package contains integration tests for the indexer. The tests are written in typescript and use the [jest](https://jestjs.io/) testing framework.

They also depend on the `local-network` repository to run a full local network with indexer components.

## Getting started

Dependencies:

- node.js
- yarn
- docker
- docker-compose

## Running the tests

To run the tests, you need to have the `local-network` repository cloned and running. Follow the instructions in the `local-network` repository to set up the local network using docker compose.
