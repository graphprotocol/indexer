## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- Update Ethers dependencies

### Added
- Support type 0x2 transactions

## [0.17.0] - 2021-07-21
### Added
- Reallocate to subgraph deployment in one transaction using closeAndAllocate.
- Wait for gas prices below the `gas-price-max` (gwei) before proceeding with transaction execution.

### Changed
- Show subgraph query error reason in logs.
- Use `ClusterIP` in the k8s indexer agent service rather than a `LoadBalalancer` since `LoadBalancer` services have been
  shown to introduce extra latency.
- Use undefined for auth user and password if none specified.
- Update `gas-price-max` units to be gwei instead of wei for improved human readability.
- Default `gas-price-max` changed from 20 gwei to 50 gwei.

### Fixed
- Improve robustness of subgraph deployments query by querying batches of only 10 deployments at a time.

## [0.16.0] - 2021-06-09
### Changed
- Default to only one transaction retry attempt to reduce gas usage
- Apply allocation claim threshold to redeeming query fee vouchers as well
